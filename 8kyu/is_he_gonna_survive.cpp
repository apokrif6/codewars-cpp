//A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

//Return True if yes, False otherwise :)

bool hero(int bullets, int dragons) {
  return bullets >= (dragons * 2);
}
