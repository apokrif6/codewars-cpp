//Complete the function that takes two numbers as input, num and nth and return the nth digit of num (counting from right to left).
//Note

//    If num is negative, ignore its sign and treat it as a positive value
//    If nth is not positive, return -1
//    Keep in mind that 42 = 00042. This means that findDigit(42, 5) would return 0

//Examples(num, nth --> output)

//5673, 4 --> 5
//129, 2 --> 2
//-2825, 3 --> 8
//-456, 4 --> 0
//0, 20 --> 0
//65, 0 --> -1
//24, -8 --> -1

int findDigit(int num, int nth) {
  if (nth <= 0)
      return -1;
  
  num = abs(num);

  for (int i = 1; i < nth; ++i)
  {
      num = num / 10;
  }  
  
  return num % 10;
