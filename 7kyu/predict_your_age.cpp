//My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

//In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

//    Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
//    Multiply each number by itself.
//    Add them all together.
//    Take the square root of the result.
///    Divide by two.

//Example

//predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86

//Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

//Some random tests might fail due to a bug in the JavaScript implementation. Simply resubmit if that happens to you.

#include <math.h>
int predictAge(int age1, int age2, int age3, int age4, int age5, int age6, int age7, int age8)

  return sqrt(
          age1 * age1 + 
          age2 * age2 + 
          age3 * age3 + 
          age4 * age4 + 
          age5 * age5 +
