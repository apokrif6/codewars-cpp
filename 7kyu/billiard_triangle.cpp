//Remember the triangle of balls in billiards? To build a classic triangle (5 levels) you need 15 balls. With 3 balls you can build a 2-level triangle, etc.

//For more examples,

//pyramid(1) == 1

//pyramid(3) == 2

//pyramid(6) == 3

//pyramid(10) == 4

//pyramid(15) == 5

//Write a function that takes number of balls (â‰¥ 1) and calculates how many levels you can build a triangle.

int pyramid(int n) {  
  int level = 0;
  
  while (n > 0)
  {
    n -= ++level;
    
    if (n < 0)
      return level - 1;
  }
  
  return level;
}
